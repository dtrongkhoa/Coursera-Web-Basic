        <h2>WWF History</h2>
        <span>
        <p>&quot;The World Wide Fund&quot; for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working
            on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the
            environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.

        <p class = "highlight mainpoint"> A Melbourne tradie plunged a kitchen knife into his best mate’s heart during a brawl at a party then climbed
            down the side of a building in a bid to escape, a court has heard.

            Rian Farrell on Tuesday pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the killing of his childhood friend Liam Cahill
            during a fight at a Docklands party in May 2020.

            The Supreme Court of Victoria pre-sentence hearing heard Farrell, 23, asked Mr Cahill to leave the birthday
            party following an earlier clash with another guest but he refused.

            “You’re my best friend, why do I have to leave?” Mr Cahill asked his friend in the minutes before the fatal
            attack.
