        <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working
            on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the 
            environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.

        <p>    A Melbourne tradie plunged a kitchen knife into his best mate’s heart during a brawl at a party then climbed down the side of a building in a bid to escape, a court has heard.

Rian Farrell on Tuesday pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the killing of his childhood friend Liam Cahill during a fight at a Docklands party in May 2020.

The Supreme Court of Victoria pre-sentence hearing heard Farrell, 23, asked Mr Cahill to leave the birthday party following an earlier clash with another guest but he refused.

“You’re my best friend, why do I have to leave?” Mr Cahill asked his friend in the minutes before the fatal attack.
